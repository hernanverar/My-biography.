        <h3><p><em>About Hernan Verar</em></p></h3>
        <p>I'm formerly a General Contractor with over 20 years of experience. The second week of December, I shut down business to begin this new journey. Born in Mexico, I left my family at the age of 17 to come to the U.S. to embark on my first big journey. I went from working at KFC knowing little to no English to having my own construction company. Now I feel that it is time to move to the next chapter. It's a big change, I know it will be a challenge but I'm happy to be in this program.</p>

          <p>My first week at Epicodus has been fun. Switching careers is not easy but I feel good and better prepared coming back to the program the secontimem around, it has been a steep learning curve but having my classmates support has made it a lot easier. They don't call it a <em>bootcamp</em> for no reason!
            I have lots of hobbies including snowboarding, mountain biking, surfing, working on house projects and sprinter van projects, although I think it will be hard to do anything else other than coding for the next few months. 

        <h3><p><em>Goals for the next 27 weeks:</em></p></h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Finish the program!</li>
            <li>Learn how to troubleshoot github, git commits, add my READMES.</li>
            <li>Meet my weekend independent projects code reviews.</li>
            <li>Continue improving my coding career.</li>
          </ul>
